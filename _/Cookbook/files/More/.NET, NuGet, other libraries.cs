/// NuGet packages also can be used without installing SDK, but then installing them isn't so easy. Need to download and extract packages and their dependencies. NuGet packages are .zip files with file extension .nupkg. Usually need just the .dll file, and .xml if exists. In .nupkg files usually they are in /lib/netX or /lib/netstandardX or /runtimes/win/lib/netX. Extract them for example to the Libraries subfolder of the editor's folder, or to the dll subfolder of the workspace folder, or anywhere.

/// When a NuGet package or some other library is installed, need to add its reference to scripts where you want to use it. You can do it in the NuGet dialog or in Properties. Then you'll find one or more new namespaces in the Ctrl+Space list, and can use them.
