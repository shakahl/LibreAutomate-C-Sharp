/// You can create custom toolbars, and attach them to windows or screen edges. Toolbar buttons can execute any code, for example run scripts and programs.

/// To create initial toolbar code easily, use menu TT -> New toolbar.

/// Quick ways to add a toolbar button:
/// - Clone an existing button.
/// - Snippet: start typing "tool" and select toolbarButtonSnippet in the list.
/// - Drag and drop a script, file, folder or link. Then select "t[name] = ...".

/// To set button icon: click the button in the code editor, and double-click an icon in the Icons dialog.

/// Click the Run button to apply changes after editing.
/// To show a window-attached toolbar, open or activate its trigger window. The toolbar initially is in its top-left corner. Shift+drag to move it to another place relative to the window.
/// Toolbar properties can be changed in code and in the right-click menu.

/// To delete a toolbar:
/// - If it's in a separate file, you can delete the file.
/// - Else delete its function and trigger.
/// - To disable temporarily, just comment out the trigger.

/// To see a list of currently running toolbars and find lost toolbars, use menu TT -> Active toolbars. It shows toolbar rectangles. Right-click to show a context menu.
