/// To create an .exe program from a script, in Properties select role exeProgram. Program files will be created whenever you compile or run the script.
///
/// The .exe program can run on computers with installed .NET Runtime (version: menu Help -> About). Don't need to install the editor program. If the program is launched on a computer without .NET, it gives a link to the .NET download page, and it's easy/fast to download and install it.
///
/// Before releasing/deploying/distributing the created program, check "optimize" in Properties and compile the script. It creates 64-bit and 32-bit files. Else the program can't run on 32-bit OS.
///
/// If need single file, you can add program files to a .zip file. Or create an installer program, for example with <google>Inno Setup</google>. The editor can't pack all files into a single .exe file ready to run.
///
/// These script properties are not applied to .exe programs launched not from the editor:
/// - ifRunning. Multiple instances (processes) of the program can run simultaneously. To prevent it can be used <see cref="script.single"/>.
/// - uac. By default programs run not as administrator (unlike when launched from the editor) and therefore can't automate admin windows etc. See  <help articles/UAC>UAC<>.
/// 
/// You can sell your created .exe programs. If need an advanced licensing system, look for a licensing library in <+recipe>NuGet<>.
///
/// Program files can be easily decompiled into readable source code. For protection can be used a .NET obfuscator.
///
/// <see cref="print.it"/> text is displayed in the editor if it is running, unless it's a console program. See also <see cref="print.Server"/>.
///
/// If you want to use action triggers (hotkeys etc) in .exe program, add them to the script like in the <see cref="Au.Triggers.ActionTriggers"/> example.
///
/// To get program/OS/computer info can be used classes <see cref="script"/>, <see cref="process"/>, <see cref="uacInfo"/>, <see cref="osVersion"/>, <see cref="folders"/>, <see cref="Environment"/>.
///
/// Antivirus programs and OS may block or block-scan-restart unknown (new) program files. To avoid it, need to sign them with a code signing certificate; it isn't cheap and isn't easy to get.
