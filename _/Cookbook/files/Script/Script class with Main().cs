/// The default script syntax is known as <google>C# top-level statements</google>. You can instead use the classic C# syntax with class Program and function Main. To insert code can be used menu Edit -> Insert -> Add class Program.

//.
class Program { static void Main(string[] a) => new Program(a); Program(string[] args) { //...
script.setup(trayIcon: true, sleepExit: true);
//..

print.it("script code");
_field1 = 1;
Function1();

}

int _field1; //this is a field, not a local variable
void Function1() {  } //this is a class function, not a local function

}

/// Why to use such code? Because the default syntax has some limitations. The classic syntax allows to:
/// - Add fields (class-level variables) and class-level functions to the main class.
/// - Add class/method-level modifiers and attributes, such as <.k>partial<>, <.k>unsafe<>, [MTAThread].
/// - Split the main class into partial files. See recipe <+recipe>Multi-file scripts<>.
/// - Avoid <google>intellisense</google> failures that sometimes happen when typing code not in a { } block.

/// You can remove code <mono>=> new Program(a); Program(string[] args)<>. It just makes writing code a bit easier, because then don't need to use static functions and static fields. It creates a class instance, and the script code is executed in the constructor.
