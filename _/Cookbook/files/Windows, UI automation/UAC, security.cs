/// <google UAC User Account Control>UAC</google> is a Windows security feature. It does not allow most programs to change some important files and Windows settings. Only processes that run as administrator can do it. Also non-admin processes cannot interact with windows of admin processes.

/// The script editor process normally runs as administrator, unless incorrectly installed. Scripts run in separate processes. They inherit the editor's integrity level (admin/nonadmin), unless a different level is specified in script Properties or the .exe script is launched not by the editor.

/// Classes and functions that can be used to get UAC-related info: <see cref="uacInfo"/>, <see cref="wnd.Uac"/>, <see cref="wnd.UacAccessDenied"/>.

print.it(uacInfo.isAdmin, uacInfo.ofThisProcess.IntegrityLevel);

/// When an admin process creates a new process, normally the new process is admin too. However <see cref="run.it"/> by default creates a non-admin process.

/// Non-admin processes have these limitations (and more).
/// - Can't write to some folders, including Windows and Program Files.
/// - Can't write to some registry parts, including HKEY_LOCAL_SYSTEM and HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT.
/// - Can't manipulate services.
/// - Can't use some Windows API.
/// - Can't interact with admin windows: send keys and mouse clicks, use UI elements, manipulate windows, send Windows messages, etc.
/// - While an admin window is active, non-admin processes can't use most triggers, hooks and hotkeys, get key/mouse states.
/// 
/// Admin processes have some strange UAC-related problems too.
/// - Admin processes can't easily start non-admin processes. It is possible with workarounds only.
/// - You can't drag and drop files etc from a non-admin to addmin process.
/// - Admin processes can't get active COM objects from non-admin processes.
/// - Admin processes don't see drive letter mappings done by non-admin processes. In scripts use network path, like "\\server\share\file" instead of "Z:".
