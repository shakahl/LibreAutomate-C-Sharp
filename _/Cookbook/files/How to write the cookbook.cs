/*
The source of cookbook folders and recipes is workspace "Cookbook" in app folder.
The program presents it as the cookbook tree: folder -> folder, script -> recipe, others ignored.
When a node is selected in the tree, the program parses the script and presents as a recipe.
A script can contain doc comments and codes.
Doc comments (/// TEXT and /** TEXT) are rendered as text.
	Can contain <see> and Au output tags.
	Must be at the start of a line.
Other code is rendered as code examples. Including //comments.
Below is an example script.
