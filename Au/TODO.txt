Add these functions and classes. All are in QM2.

computer:
	isLoggedOn. Maybe .NET has it, eg Environment.UserName/UserInteractive.
	getIpAddress. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6803073/get-local-ip-address
	getCpuUsage, getDiskUsage.
process:
	getCpuUsage, getStartupTime (.NET Process has it?).
IntCheckConnection, IntGetFile (now recipe exists).
outb, DetectStringEncoding.

Review functions/classes in QM2 Archive. Now reviewed all in qm.exe and System.

CONSIDER
TempFile class. Already created, in script "TempFile". Not sure is it so useful.
WaitIdle, ResumeWhenIdle. But in my QM2 workspace used 0 times.
