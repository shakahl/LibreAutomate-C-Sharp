#### About "run script"
The started Au.Editor.exe process is an intermediate temporary process, not the regular editor process with UI. It just relays the command line to the regular process, waits if need, and exits. Also it starts the regular process if not running. The regular process compiles and starts the script.

Use prefix * to wait until the script ends. While waiting, the parent process can read script's [script.writeResult]() text from standard output of the child process. If parent process is console, it automatically displays the text. Or it can redirect standard output, like [run.console]() does.

The exit code of this process when it waits is the script's exit code. The script can simply return it, like `return 1;` or call **Environment.Exit**. When does not wait, the exit code is the process id of the script. When fails to run (script not found, contains errors, etc) or wait, the exit code is < 0 (can be -1 to -7).
