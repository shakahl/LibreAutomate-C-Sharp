ifi : what does the i stand for? it made me think it stood 
for "inactive"; it may be more understandable to have it be "ife"

Ck starts up Recorder, is it supposed to?

winapiQM.txt
When i upgraded QM, i found that the Reference file setting
in QM settings pointed to the one in an older directory,
not to the winapiQM.txt file in the newer directory (i upgraded
to a different directory. I dont know, but u may want to
post a message asking if user wants reference to point to new
file.

Can you stop other hard disks from spinning up when overwriting file?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
QM appears to access other drive(s) when overwriting a flie. I exported a folder named 
555 to be overwriten to another file called 555.qml. Suddenly my other hardisk(s)
started up. 

Ok i found out why - because it sent the file to the recycle bin, and windows has
a nasty habit of starting up all drives if any file is sent to recycle bin.

Case of the mysterious "Modified from outside" due to corrupt qml file sent in last email
=========================================================================================

Another note below, from March, that was attached to the above note, 
i cant remember the circumstances, other than that that file you last 
sent me had a "bad file format" error so i had to extract all the macros
you sent me using Metapad. I then placed them into a folder called "55".

(Ive put the file, sent to me on Mon, March 3, 2003, at: 
www.geocities.com/rsrapr/not_working.rar.zip
if you want to analyse it. Open archive with winrar: www.rarlab.com.
Qm still wont import it.)

Note from March: 
"That file: sais its a "QM: bad file format". then a message pops up saying the file has
been modified from outside and asks if i want to reload. But no other computer
is connected to my file at the time."


UPDATE: November 20 - i duplicated the above scenario:
1) I tried to import that corrupt file 
2) Renamed it, tried to import it again
3) Soon i was presented with the message that my main qml file has been modified from outside
4) I went to Windows Explorer and saved a copy of the main qml file
5) Then, to avoid possibly corrupting my main qml file from the "modified" one
I chose to Overwrite, rather than reload the file 
(could my main file now be corrupt? should i revert to a backup?)

6) Did a ASCII file compare on the two files, and only lines 3&4 show a difference*
7) Tried to do a BINARY file compare, but that was taking forever so i gave up


* ASCII compare of copies of main qml file:
First file is the one that was currently loaded into qm
Second one is the one that was mysteriously reported as having been "modified from outside"
 - the second one is the copy i saved before overwriting it using "Overwrite" option in the dialog
